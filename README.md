Abstract:
In the era of automation, the demand for systems that operate with minimal human intervention has soared. Performing tasks autonomously is crucial for reducing operational costs and ensuring a consistent user experience. Facial recognition has emerged as a powerful tool with diverse applications, revolutionizing attendance management practices. Attendance management systems using facial detection (AMSFDs) offer many benefits, including enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and convenience. Our project presents a comprehensive system design that initiates attendance management by detecting and distinguishing faces from background elements. Subsequently, the system cross-references the captured facial image against a pre-established database, generating a set of data for further  processing. After thorough analysis, the processed data is forwarded to the attendance tracking system, which is stored in a readily accessible and shareable format. AMSFDs have emerged as a transformative technology, providing organizations with a more accurate, efficient, and convenient method for managing employee attendance. AMSFDs are poised to revolutionize attendance management practices across industries, enhancing productivity, security, and overall operational efficiency. Our proposed AMSFD aims to achieve these goals through enhanced implementation and design principles.
